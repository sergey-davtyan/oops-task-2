# Innovate Inc. - Cloud Architecture Summary

## Executive Overview

This document provides a consolidated view of Innovate Inc.'s cloud infrastructure architecture, designed specifically for a small startup with ambitious growth plans. Our approach balances immediate operational simplicity with long-term scalability, security, and cost-effectiveness.

**Company Context**: Innovate Inc. is a small startup developing a web application with a React SPA frontend hosted on S3/CloudFront and a Python/Flask REST API backend running on EKS, with PostgreSQL database. The application expects to grow from hundreds of users to potentially millions.

**Architecture Philosophy**: Start simple, secure by default, and scale without major rework.

**Key Design Principles**:
- **Multi-account isolation** for security and cost control
- **Private networking** with minimal public exposure
- **Managed services** to reduce operational overhead
- **Security-first** approach with compliance-ready foundations
- **Cost-conscious** design that scales efficiently
- **Separation of concerns** with frontend on S3/CloudFront and backend on EKS

## Cloud Environment Structure

### Recommended Account Strategy (5 → 8 Accounts)

**Startup-Friendly Approach**: Begin with 5 accounts to establish proper isolation without overwhelming complexity, then grow to 8 as the organization scales.

#### Initial Setup (5 Accounts)
1. **Management Account** - Organization root, consolidated billing
2. **Security + Log Archive Account** - Combined security controls, monitoring, and logging
3. **Shared Services + CI/CD Account** - Combined networking, platform tools, and deployment automation
4. **Non-Production Account** - Combined development and staging environments
5. **Production Account** - Customer-facing workloads

**Why This Structure?**
- **Blast radius reduction**: Issues in dev can't impact production
- **Clear cost attribution**: Each environment has its own budget and alerts
- **Security boundaries**: Different policies per environment
- **Operational safety**: Separate CI/CD from workloads
- **Startup-friendly**: Begin with manageable complexity, grow as needed

---

## Network Design

### VPC Architecture (Per Environment)
- **3 Availability Zones** for high availability
- **Private-first approach**: Only load balancers and NAT gateways in public subnets
- **VPC Endpoints** for AWS services to reduce internet egress costs
- **Security Groups** as primary access control mechanism

### Security Layers
1. **Edge**: CloudFront + WAF for DDoS protection and OWASP rules
2. **Frontend**: S3 with Origin Access Control, no public access
3. **Load Balancing**: ALB with TLS termination and access logging
4. **VPC**: Private subnets, security groups, network policies
5. **Backend**: EKS with pod security standards and network policies
6. **Data**: RDS in private subnets with encryption and IAM auth

**Cost Optimization**: Start with single NAT gateway in non-prod, scale to per-AZ in production

---

## Frontend Architecture (S3 + CloudFront)

### S3 Hosting Strategy
- **Static asset hosting** for React SPA in private S3 buckets
- **CloudFront distribution** with Origin Access Control (OAC) for secure access
- **Global edge caching** for improved performance and reduced costs
- **Immutable file names** with content hashing for cache busting

### Frontend Benefits
- **Cost-effective**: Pay only for storage and data transfer
- **Highly scalable**: No compute resources needed for frontend
- **Global performance**: CloudFront edge locations worldwide
- **Security**: Private S3 buckets with OAC, no public access

---

## Backend Compute Platform (EKS)

### Cluster Strategy
- **One cluster per environment** (dev, staging, prod)
- **Private nodes** with no public IPs
- **Managed node groups** initially, with Karpenter for future cost optimization
- **Focused on API workloads** only (no frontend serving)

### Node Group Design
- **System nodes**: t3.medium/large for controllers and monitoring
- **API nodes**: m6i.large for Flask backend workloads
- **Spot nodes** (non-prod first): For cost optimization on non-critical workloads

### Scaling Approach
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler** for API scaling based on CPU/memory
- **Cluster Autoscaler** for node scaling (replace with Karpenter later)
- **Resource quotas** and limits enforced via policies

### Containerization
- **Multi-stage Dockerfiles** for security and size optimization
- **Amazon ECR** for image storage with scanning and signing
- **Non-root containers** with read-only filesystems
- **Flask/Gunicorn optimization** for production workloads

---

## Database Architecture

### Service Choice: RDS PostgreSQL
**Why RDS over Aurora initially?**
- **Lower cost** for startup budgets
- **Simpler operations** for small teams
- **Easy migration path** to Aurora when scale demands it

### High Availability
- **Multi-AZ deployment** for automatic failover
- **RDS Proxy** for connection pooling and IAM authentication
- **Read replicas** for scaling read workloads

### Security & Compliance
- **Customer-managed KMS keys** for encryption
- **Private subnets** with no public access
- **IAM database authentication** via RDS Proxy
- **Automated backups** with point-in-time recovery

### Disaster Recovery
- **Cross-region snapshots** for backup protection
- **Read replica in secondary region** for warm standby
- **Automated backup testing** monthly

---

## Security & Compliance

### Identity & Access
- **AWS IAM Identity Center** for centralized SSO
- **No IAM users** in workload accounts
- **Cross-account roles** for CI/CD and operations
- **Just-in-time access** for production with MFA

### Guardrails
- **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** to enforce organizational policies
- **Mandatory tagging** for cost and security tracking
- **Region restrictions** to prevent sprawl
- **Encryption requirements** for data at rest and in transit

### Monitoring & Detection
- **GuardDuty** for threat detection across all accounts
- **Security Hub** for compliance monitoring
- **Centralized logging** to immutable log archive
- **Automated alerting** for security events

---

## Cost Management

### Budget Controls
- **Cost categories** for environment and team attribution
- **Savings Plans** purchased centrally and allocated

### Cost Optimization
- **Frontend**: S3 + CloudFront is highly cost-effective for static content
- **Backend**: Spot instances for non-critical workloads
- **VPC endpoints** to reduce NAT gateway costs
- **Storage lifecycle** policies for backups

### Growth Planning
- **Start small** with room to scale vertically
- **Plan for Aurora migration** when performance demands increase
